## <span style="color:blue"> Projects </span>

### <span style="color:green"> DeepWatcher- Protecting Social Media from Deepfakes </span>
- Employs advanced deep-learning techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs), to **analyze images and videos in real-time** as they are uploaded to social media platforms.
- Prioritizing prevention over remediation. Instead of waiting for **deepfake content** to cause harm and then addressing it, DeepWatcher stops it at the source, **ensuring that manipulated content never reaches the public domain.**
- DeepWatcher enhances user trust and engagement, ultimately **benefiting both individuals and social media platforms** alike.

### <span style="color:green"> Unhigh-gene: Computational Analysis of Genome Sequences </span>
- Designed gene sequencing algorithms to **analyze the genetic sequences of prospective parents**, providing a comprehensive understanding of **potential genetic diseases their offspring might inherit**.
- **Examining both parental and grandparental genetic data**, it offers a thorough assessment of recessive genetic disorders, enabling a more **accurate prediction of disease probabilities in future generations**.
- Instead of manual examination of nucleotide combinations, Unhigh-gene employs **algorithms for each genetic disease, streamlining the detection process**. This automated computational approach **significantly reduces the time and effort required by geneticists**, ensuring faster and more efficient analysis of genetic disorders.
