## Projects

### DeepWatcher- Protecting Social Media from Deepfakes
- Employs advanced deep-learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze images and videos in real-time as they are uploaded to social media platforms.
- Prioritizing prevention over remediation. Instead of waiting for deepfake content to cause harm and then addressing it, DeepWatcher stops it at the source, ensuring that manipulated content never reaches the public domain.
- DeepWatcher enhances user trust and engagement, ultimately benefiting both individuals and social media platforms alike.
